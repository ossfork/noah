# Noah for Tinkerers

**Let an AI fix your computer — without letting it run wild.** Noah for Tinkerers is the
open-source, bring-your-own-key build of Noah: a desktop app that diagnoses and resolves
computer problems in plain English, with a safety harness around every action.

You bring an Anthropic API key; Noah talks to Claude directly from your machine. No
subscription and no account — just the app, your key, and your computer.

> ### 👉 Just want it to work?
> **[onnoah.app](https://onnoah.app)** is the commercial version — the same app, fully
> managed. No API key, no setup, nothing to configure: download, describe the problem, done.
> Free to start. **This repo is the BYOK build** for tinkerers who'd rather bring their own
> key, read the source, and hack on it.

> **Why not just point Claude or Codex at your machine?** Raw models have no guardrails —
> they'll happily `rm -rf` the wrong thing — and sandboxed tools can't touch the real system
> you're trying to fix. Noah is the middle path: a real desktop agent that runs read-only
> diagnostics first, shows you the plan, gates destructive actions behind explicit approval,
> and hard-blocks the truly catastrophic ones outright (wiping your home folder or keychains,
> erasing a disk).

<p align="center"><i>You say "my computer is slow." Noah finds the problem, explains the fix, and handles it.</i></p>

## How it works

1. **Describe the problem** — in your own words, no jargon needed
2. **Noah investigates** — runs diagnostics silently in the background
3. **Noah shows you the plan** — what it found and what it wants to do
4. **You approve** — Noah handles the rest and confirms the fix

Every action is logged and reversible. Risky operations require your explicit approval; the truly catastrophic ones — wiping your home folder or keychains, erasing a disk — are blocked outright and can't be approved away.

## Beyond chat: Health, Playbooks, Auto-Heal

Noah isn't just a chatbot — it monitors your machine and can fix problems before you notice them.

- **Health Scorecards** — background checks across five categories (Security, Updates, Performance, Backups, Network) grade your machine A–F, with one-click fixes for what's failing.
- **Playbooks** — 25+ built-in Markdown remediation scripts (disk recovery, network diagnostics, printer repair, VPN, backups, browser security, performance forensics, and more). Drop in your own and Noah runs them as guided or automated fixes.
- **Auto-Heal** — when enabled, Noah triages failing checks, picks the right playbook, runs it, and measures the result in the background. Your machine fixes itself.

## What Noah can do

| Category | Mac | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| **Network** — DNS, connectivity, flush cache, test hosts | Yes | Yes |
| **Printers** — queue, cancel jobs, restart print service | Yes | Yes |
| **Performance** — CPU/memory/disk, stop runaway processes | Yes | Yes |
| **Apps** — logs, clear caches, troubleshoot crashes | Yes | Yes |
| **System** — diagnostics, health checks, shell commands | Yes | Yes |
| **Updates** — detect stale OS, troubleshoot stuck updates | Yes | Yes |
| **Security** — firewall, encryption, endpoint checks | Yes | Yes |
| **Backups** — Time Machine status, backup verification | Yes | — |
| **Knowledge** — remembers your system, past fixes, preferences | Yes | Yes |
| **Health Scorecards** — continuous monitoring with A-F grades | Yes | Yes |
| **Playbooks** — guided and automated remediation | Yes | Yes |
| **Auto-Heal** — background self-repair on failing checks | Yes | Yes |

## Get started

### Download

Grab the BYOK build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/noahapp/noah-for-tinkerers/releases):
- **macOS** — `.dmg` (universal, Apple Silicon + Intel)
- **Windows** — `.msi` / `.exe` (x64)
- **Linux** — `.AppImage`

Noah keeps itself up to date after install.

> Don't want to manage an API key? The managed version at **[onnoah.app](https://onnoah.app)**
> is the same app with nothing to set up — download and go.

### Bring your own Anthropic key

Open **Settings** and paste an Anthropic key (it starts with `sk-ant-`) — or set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before launching. Your key is stored locally on your device and used
only to authenticate your own calls to Anthropic. The app has no accounts and no paywall;
the only other network calls are an update check and an anonymous, opt-out usage ping
(toggle it off in Settings).

## Safety

- **Looks before it leaps** — always runs read-only diagnostics first
- **Shows you the plan** — you see exactly what Noah will do before it does it
- **Flags risky actions** — `rm`, `sudo`, disk formatting, and similar commands require explicit approval with a plain-language explanation
- **Logs everything** — every action is recorded in a session journal you can review
- **Hard limits** — the catastrophic operations (wiping your home folder or keychains, erasing a disk) are blocked outright and can't be approved away; everything else risky is gated behind your explicit approval
- **Your key stays yours** — stored locally and used only to authenticate your own calls to Anthropic; it's never sent to a Noah server

## Design notes

How Noah is built, in depth — engineering design docs, each verified against the code:

- [Architecture](docs/design/0-architecture.md) — the LLM thinks, the local machine acts
- [Generative UI](docs/design/1-generative-ui.md) — the model fills UI slots instead of drawing components
- [One thread](docs/design/2-one-thread.md) — text, UI, and tool calls share one conversation stream
- [The safety harness](docs/design/3-safety-harness.md) — running real commands without running wild
- [Every command explains itself](docs/design/4-command-explanations.md) — plain-English reasons, enforced by schema
- [Playbooks](docs/design/5-playbooks.md) — Markdown as remediation programs
- [Bring your own key](docs/design/6-bring-your-own-key.md) — an agent with no backend

## Open source & contributing
